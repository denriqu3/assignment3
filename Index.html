    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Donovan Enriquez, and I'm a junior at Nazareth College from San Diego, CA. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Communications and Media and Community Youth Development. I currently work as a photographer and blogger for Naz's MarComm Team. Though I'm still learning a lot about DSLR cameras and photography in general, I love capturing the stories behind a single snapshot.</p>
