    <h2>iPhone Photos</h2>
    <p>You really don't need a fancy camera or expensive equipment to be a photographer. Sure, they help when you're trying to get sharper quality and play around in different lighting or with fast-moving subjects. However, as an amateur photographer, my phone has served me well and is much more convenient to carry around.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Benefits of using an iPhone</strong></em>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Compact and easy to carry around</em></li>
            <li><em>User friendly with automatic lighting settings</em></li>
            <li><em>Efficient sharing options</em></li>
        </ul>
